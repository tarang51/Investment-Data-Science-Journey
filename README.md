MSc Statistics student building a bridge between hard math and Agentic AI in Finance
Project: Manual Volatility vs. AI-Driven Refactoring
In this project, I bridge my MSc in Applied Statistics knowledge with professional Python engineering.

Manual Implementation: I first coded the Standard Deviation formula from scratch using for loops to ensure mathematical accuracy.

AI-Pair Programming: I then acted as a "Lead Engineer" and used Generative AI to refactor my logic into an Object-Oriented (OOP) structure for scalability.

Why this matters: In finance, we need deterministic results. This project proves I understand the underlying statistics while being capable of using AI to speed up professional development.
